Overall review of the application
Used React for the application view
Used Redux for the application state
Created an action creator and use of middlewares redux-promise
Used AXIOS for AJAX request
Used reducers for avoiding the state mutations
For building of charts used a library called react sparklines
Used React google maps for displaying the cities
